// @crm/shared: UI wording and Zod schemas shared by apps/web and apps/api (plan.md § Project
// Structure). Browser-safe: no node: imports, no env reads.
//
// B-01 correction (run-log.md): the copied `labels.ts`/`urls.ts` (and their tests) depended on
// `@crm/contract`, a vendored copy of Task A's contract (architecture-constitution.md §9's
// `packages/oracle-contract`) that T001 never copies into this repo — B-01 reads no property,
// permit, contractor or BBB data at all (data-model.md, constitution Task-B addendum B1), so
// nothing in this story needs those provenance-label helpers. They are removed here, not ported,
// and return when the story that actually vendors `packages/oracle-contract` needs them.
