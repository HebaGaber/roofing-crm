// binding bands — PO-accepted 2026-10-23, per agent-design.md's "Corrections found while
// compiling" #1 — which supersede both the story's looser "<0.80 -> clarify" paraphrase and
// alakazam's own free-text drift in the same design consult. B-09 calibrates these on the place
// fixture set and records the final values here, versioned, so a later recalibration is a
