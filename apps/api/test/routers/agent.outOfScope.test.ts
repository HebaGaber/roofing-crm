// T027 (B-09, Phase 4/US1), rewritten for the 009-agent-hardening architecture fix: the scope
// gate (docs/decisions/0000-agent-architecture.md §5) is now **code-enforced**, not a
// system-prompt instruction the model could ignore. `apps/api/src/agent/composeAnswer.ts`'s
// `checkScope` runs in plain TypeScript right after the plan call is Zod-validated, and
// `runAsk`'s own control flow never calls `dispatchPlan` or the compose model on any branch
// other than `"in_scope"` — there is no code path from an out-of-scope `ZIP` to a dispatch/tool
// call, structurally, not just by convention.
//
// This test proves that two ways: (1) the mocked model's `doGenerate` was called exactly once
// (just the plan call — a second call would be the old tool-loop/compose-call shape this
// architecture no longer has), and (2) the fake `LeadIndex`'s `searchProperties`/`searchPermits`
// are spied and asserted never invoked — the actual code-level proof the scope gate works, which
// the old single-`generateText`-call test couldn't assert (tools were always available to that
// one call, so "no tool call happened" was the model's choice, not a structural guarantee).
