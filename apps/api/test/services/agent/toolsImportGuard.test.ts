// T029 (B-09, Phase 4/US1): the confirm-flow-bypass guard from `agent-design.md` ash §5 /
// contracts/agent-api.md's `agent.confirmLead` section ("A grep of
// `apps/api/src/services/agent/tools.ts` for any `LeadService`/`requireLeadService` import must
// come back empty; it is only ever imported by this router handler" — meaning
// `routers/agent.ts`'s `confirmLead` handler, never the model's own tool set).
//
// Sequenced in Phase 4, not Phase 2 (tasks.md's note on T029): `tools.ts` is created by this same
// phase (T032, builder: alakazam), in parallel with this test. If it doesn't exist yet when this
// runs, the test fails on file-not-found (`fs.readFileSync` ENOENT) — the correct TDD-first
// failure (constitution XXI), not a bad assertion in the test body below. Once `tools.ts` exists,
// this becomes a real static/import-graph check: it reads the file's own source text and parses
// every `import ... from "..."` declaration, so a future rename or re-export cannot quietly slip
// `LeadService`/`requireLeadService` back in without this test's regex catching it.
