// Found deploying (not in the original T005-TN02 scope): Cognito's PreAuthentication trigger
// can't observe a failed password (see auth/lockout-handler.ts's module header for the full
// design). This public, unauthenticated procedure is the client-reported half of the fix —
// apps/web calls it when Cognito's own SRP sign-in throws NotAuthorizedException, so a failed
// attempt actually increments data-model.md's LockoutCounter. Public by necessity (called before
// any session exists, same as health.ping) and client-reported, hence spoofable in principle;
// accepted for this story (one shared admin login, no public attacker surface worth hardening
// against here) — decided with the user rather than assumed.
