// tRPC init (plan.md "Patterns the code must show"). One root `t` for the whole AppRouter; every
// procedure's input is Zod-validated (constitution P0-11, Article V). The Cognito JWT authorizer
// runs in API Gateway before a request reaches the Lambda (architecture-constitution.md § Data
// Flow), so there is no auth middleware here — `health.ping` and `auth.reportFailedAttempt` are
// the two routes API Gateway lets through without a token (contracts/health.md; the latter found
// deploying — see routers/auth.ts — it's called before any session exists, same reason as
// health.ping), and every other route never reaches this file without a validated token already
// attached to the request context.
