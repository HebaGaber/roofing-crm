// 009-agent-hardening architecture fix (ADR-06 §§4-6.3 as actually accepted, docs/decisions/
// 0000-agent-architecture.md; contracts/agent-api.md's `agent.ask` steps). This module owns the
// whole turn's orchestration (`runAsk`, below): plan call, Zod-validate against the real
// `QueryPlan` schema with one repair call, follow-up inheritance from the thread's last plan, the
// code-enforced scope gate, deterministic dispatch by `plan.intent`, the compose call, and server
// verification of citations *and* claim text. `runAgent.ts`'s `generateOnce` is never given
// `tools`, and the scope gate runs in plain TypeScript between the plan call and any dispatch — so
// an out-of-scope question cannot reach a search or the compose call, because this function's own
// control flow never calls them on that path (proven by
// `apps/api/test/routers/agent.outOfScope.test.ts`: `doGenerate` called exactly once, the fake
// `LeadIndex`'s searches never called).
//
// B-09 review round (docs/reviews/CR-B-09.md, alakazam's findings), in this file:
//  - Scope gate by intent and area kind (finding 9): only a place-name area runs place resolution.
//    A TCAD-id lookup, a permit-number lookup and a coverage question go straight to their
//    deterministic dispatch; a county-wide area must name Travis County; a ZIP must be a Travis
//    ZCTA; a point must fall inside Travis County's bounding box.
//  - Evidence rows get server-assigned citation ids in the compose DATA. A model citation label
//    resolves by the most specific id it gives (permitCid, then propertyCid, then the DATA id —
//    finding 8), and every citation the model produced counts in `citationsTotal` (finding 17).
//  - `counts`, `missing[]` and `outcome` are derived from whichever dispatch ran (finding 10); rows
//    that matched but yield no verifiable claim get a deterministic template answer, never
//    `empty_in_scope`.
//  - Claim text is checked against its cited rows (finding 11, services/agent/claimText.ts).
//  - `needs_clarification` returns the resolver's top candidates (finding 7).
//  - Slots the plan marks `inherited` take the thread's last plan's values (finding 8 remainder).
