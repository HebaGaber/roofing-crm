// The cached Leads list and a just-created lead. Creating a lead costs one round trip; the list the
// person lands on after "View leads" used to cost a second one before the row could paint. So a
// successful create goes straight into the cached `leads.list` entries it belongs to (newest first,
// shaped like a listed lead), and the list refetches in the background without anyone waiting.
//
// The leads index (GSI1) is eventually consistent, so that refetch can briefly lack the new lead.
// `overlayLeadsList` (the list hook's `select`) keeps the new lead, merged by lead key, until a
// refetch contains it or `OPTIMISTIC_WINDOW_MS` passes, and keeps an undone lead out for the same
// window. Failed creates and duplicates (409) never reach here: only a successful create does.
