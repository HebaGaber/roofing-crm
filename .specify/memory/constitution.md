Sync Impact Report
- Version: 3.0.0 → 3.1.0 (2026-10-24): B1 clarified. The CRM reads Task A's published data directly (manifest + parts by CID, manifest named by `DATA_MANIFEST_CID`); the MCP is an optional cross-check.
- Earlier: 2.0.0 → 3.0.0 (2026-10-17): Article VI redefined. Model provider is a setting: Bedrock (default) or Vercel AI Gateway (demo: embeddings now, Claude until the Bedrock quota is raised).
- Earlier: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0 (2026-10-16): Article III redefined. Region comes from config; demo deploys to eu-north-1 (region-locked AWS project), company default us-east-2.
- Earlier: 0.0.0 (template placeholders) → 1.0.0
- Added: Parts 1–3 (articles I–XXIII), Task B addendum (B1–B3), agent roster
- Templates updated: .specify/templates/plan-template.md (Kit Agent Ownership + Constitution Check),
  spec-template.md (story header), tasks-template.md (tests mandatory + Phase Z "prove on hosted runtime")

# Roofing CRM & Lead Identification UI Constitution

The binding rules for every spec, plan, task, line of code and review in this repo. `docs/architecture-constitution.md` adds component-level decisions and is equally binding once Gate G3 approves it.

## Part 1: Engineering

### I. Outcome first
A feature is done only when it works on the **hosted** runtime (`https://crm.{domain}` or its Amplify branch URL) with real Travis County data from Task A. Working on localhost does not count as done or as evidence.

### II. TypeScript everywhere
Apps, Lambdas, CDK and scripts are TypeScript. Python is forbidden except PySpark/Glue.

### III. AWS, CDK only, region from config
CDK is the only infrastructure as code. The region is never hard-coded: CDK reads it from `CDK_DEFAULT_REGION`/`AWS_REGION`. Company default `us-east-2` (Golden Path); the demo deploy uses `eu-north-1` because the demo AWS project is region-locked, and the PR says so. In the demo, Bedrock uses `eu.` cross-region inference profiles. Every resource is tagged `project_name=roofing-crm`.

### IV. Turborepo monorepo
`apps/web` (React + MapLibre → Amplify), `apps/api` (tRPC on Lambda behind API Gateway, agent, sync job), `packages/api-client` (the only tRPC client), `packages/shared` (Zod schemas, lead rules). Never duplicate the client or the types.

### V. Zod on every input
Every tRPC procedure and agent tool validates input with Zod. No `any`.

### VI. Vercel AI SDK for every LLM call
Use `ai` with Zod tool schemas. The model provider is a setting (`AI_PROVIDER=bedrock|gateway`), never hard-coded in agent code: `bedrock` uses `@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock` with `eu.` inference profiles (the default and Golden Path); `gateway` uses the Vercel AI Gateway built into `ai`, with `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` read from Secrets Manager. The demo uses the Gateway for embeddings (`amazon/titan-embed-text-v2`) and for Claude until the new account's Bedrock quota is raised. Direct provider SDKs (`openai`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime`) are forbidden.

### VII. Queued external boundaries
The lead-index sync job and any external call use bounded concurrency, idempotency keys (`property_cid`), exponential backoff, a DLQ and one self-resolving CloudWatch alarm per DLQ.

### VIII. Observability
Every Lambda uses Powertools Logger, Tracer and Metrics, with X-Ray on and JSON logs. Business metrics: items processed, items failed, duration. No secrets or PII in logs.

### IX. Alerting
Critical failures page through PagerDuty Events API v2, or a documented substitute.

### X. Quality gates in CI
Vitest, Playwright (against the hosted URL; the config fails on localhost), ESLint, Prettier and `tsc` run in GitHub Actions. A story is done only when CI is green.

### XI. Data honesty
Every property, permit and agent answer cites its source (record, source URL, manifest CID). Missing data is shown as missing ("BBB not available"), never guessed. Assumptions are stated.

### XII. No secrets
No secrets or test passwords in Git, logs or PR bodies. Use Secrets Manager.

## Part 2: Kit-agent ownership

### XIII. Every piece of work has an owner agent
Each story's front matter names `agents.design`, `agents.builder`, `agents.reviewers`, `agents.verify` and `skills`, copied from `../assessment-guide/AGENT-MAP.md`. A story without them fails Gate G4.

**Agent roster for this repo**

| Agent | Role here | Patterns that must be visible in the code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `metagross` | Primary builder: monorepo, CRM UI, API, auth, hosting, CI | Turborepo layout, tRPC + shared api-client, Amplify + CDK, Cognito, Powertools |
| `espeon` | Builder: lead search index from Oracle's published data (backfill + live sync) | prototype-to-production migration, historical backfill, refresh, index provenance |
| `machamp` | Builder: the sync batch job | idempotent batch, throttling, DLQ + alarm, cost control |
| `alakazam` | Builder: agent retrieval design | hybrid retrieval, confidence threshold, citations, golden-query evaluation |
| `ash` | Builder/reviewer: agent runtime | tool loop, conversation state, telemetry |
| `mew` | Design consult: lead as a lexicon domain extension | references lexicon identities instead of copying them |
| `porygon` | Reviewer: metric consistency (index count = Oracle count) | — |
| `audino` | Reviewer: UI drift from the design | — |
| `smeargle` | Tester: responsive tests at 390 / 768 / 1440 | — |

### XIV. The owner designs it
Before `/speckit-plan`, every `agents.design` agent is consulted read-only and its answer is saved word for word in `specs/{NNN-slug}/agent-design.md`. The plan's "Kit Agent Ownership" section cites it. A plan without it fails the Constitution Check.

### XV. The owner builds it
`/speckit-implement` delegates each task group to the `agents.builder` subagent, which loads its skills plus `apply-engineering-guidelines`. The code must show the patterns in the roster above.

### XVI. The owner reviews it
Before G7, every `agents.reviewers` agent scores the story read-only (0–100). The score is recorded in `docs/reviews/CR-{ID}.md`. A score under 75 blocks the merge until it is fixed or justified there.

### XVII. The toolchain matches the router
The `arceus` routing in `docs/01-intent.md` is the expected toolchain. Every agent it names owns or reviews at least one story, or is listed in `docs/kit-usage.md` as left out with a reason. Product configurer agents (`celebi`, `uxie`, `vivillon`, …) are not used: no Prism product is deployed for this task.

## Part 3: Delivery process

### XVIII. Gates
Each artifact ends at a gate (G0–G8). The `developmentsupport-*` pre-check reports gaps; the human records the decision. No `/speckit-implement` before G4, G5 and G6 pass. No merge before G7 passes.

### XIX. Traceability
Every artifact has front matter with `id` and `parent`. Every commit message starts with the story ID (`B-03: …`).

### XX. Branching
Work happens on `feature/roofing-crm`. Each story uses its own branch `NNN-slug`, merged back with `git merge --no-ff`. Nothing is committed to `main`. `docs/progress.md` is regenerated after every merge.

### XXI. Specs before code
Unknowns are written as `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]`. Acceptance criteria are Given / When / Then. Tests are written first and must fail first.

### XXII. Independent tests
Test cases come from the story's acceptance criteria, not from `tasks.md`, and run against the hosted URL.

### XXIII. Defects are records
Every failing hosted test gets `docs/defects/ERR-{n}.md`. No Critical defect is open at a merge or at release.

## Task B addendum

- **B1.** The CRM reads property and permit data directly from the data Task A publishes: the run manifest named by config (`DATA_MANIFEST_CID`) and the parts it lists, fetched by CID and verified against it. It needs no catalog lookup (Atlas registration or an MCP name search) to find that data. Task A's MCP is optional, for cross-checks only. No scraping, no ingestion, no access to Oracle's internal stores.
- **B2.** Leads are the CRM's own data (DynamoDB). Every lead records the source manifest CID.
- **B3.** Agent answers cite records that exist in the index. The agent never invents properties.

## Governance

This constitution overrides other practices. A plan that breaks an article either changes or records a justification in its Complexity Tracking table, which you approve. Amendments: edit this file and `../assessment-guide/templates/constitution.md` together, bump the version (MAJOR = article removed or redefined, MINOR = article added, PATCH = wording), and update the Sync Impact Report.

**Version**: 3.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-10-15 | **Last Amended**: 2026-10-17
