// config-guard.spec.ts itself: this file previously read RUNTIME_URL raw with no validation at
// all, so an explicit RUNTIME_URL=http://localhost:3000 silently ran against that instead of
// being refused. Pre-deploy (this phase), RUNTIME_URL is simply UNSET and tests run against the
// local Turborepo dev server instead (plan.md's Complexity Tracking row on Article XXI) — that
// case is intentionally exempt from the guard, which is why config-guard.spec.ts's own "unset"
// case doesn't apply to this story's design (disclosed deviation from the copied A-03 test: that
// story has no local-dev-server testing phase, this one does).

// Unset ("all") = every spec, as before this split: one worker against RUNTIME_URL, full
// parallelism against the local dev server. Both phases keep the three viewport project names
// (the responsive suite), so `--project desktop-1440` and specs that check the project name
// (B-01 AC-3) work the same in every phase. Each phase gets its own report and output folder,
// so the second invocation never clears the first.
//
// ISOLATED — each entry's reason. Everything not listed is read-only browsing of the hosted app
// as the one seeded admin (signed in once by the `setup` project) and is safe to overlap:

  // (Bedrock). Three viewports × three asks must not run concurrently with each other or with
  // anything else asking as the same user.

  // Mutates the shared admin's leads (beforeAll deletes and recreates the test leads) and is
  // `mode: "serial"` by design; two viewports at once would delete each other's leads. On CI it

// - cid-copy / fallback / manifest / verify-manifest .spec.ts: unconditional `test.skip(true)`
//   stubs (out of scope for B-02, see their headers) — no IPFS gateway traffic at all today. If
//   one is ever revived against the rate-limited public gateways, move it into ISOLATED.
// - B-01.spec.ts AC-3 lockout: locks a throwaway `lockout-probe-…@roofing-crm.test` username,
//   never the shared admin (and ERR-21 keys every lockout path by that email), runs on
//   desktop-1440 only, so it cannot lock out a concurrent correct-password sign-in.
// - config-guard.spec.ts: spawns `playwright test --list` locally; never reaches the network.
