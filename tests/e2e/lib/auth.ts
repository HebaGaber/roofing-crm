// Sign in once per Playwright invocation, then reuse the session (playwright.config.ts's `setup`
// project, tests/e2e/auth.setup.ts).
//
// The web app keeps its whole Cognito session in localStorage `crm.session`
// (apps/web/src/auth/session.ts): origin-scoped and independent of the viewport, so one saved
// storageState serves all three viewport projects. A spec that only needs a signed-in page opts
// in with `test.use({ storageState: AUTH_STATE_PATH })` and calls `openSignedIn()`; a spec that
// tests sign-in itself (B-01 AC-1/AC-3, responsive/sign-in.spec.ts) keeps signing in for real.
//
// The state file holds live Cognito tokens: it lives under `playwright/.auth/` (gitignored), is
// never attached to a report, and is never uploaded by CI (only `playwright-report/` is).
