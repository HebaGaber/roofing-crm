//   run      travis-full-run3-1-20261025 (Task A Run 3.1, contract v1.2); the pins below were read on

//            441,961 properties, 15,025 Austin permits), the same parcels, so they carry over
//   manifest bafkreidbqsav3rsbxqy5fx3li73uskfth254nz5zw34xwac5w3fd4tmbai
//   history  Run 2 (travis-full-run2-20261024, bafkreife3vk3cgcod3v6tue2xes3hvl2vndqoshbhrhsnjtriskihpcute)
//            was refreshed to Run 3 the same day; the pins and the open-permit lead survived unchanged
//
// Honest data facts behind the choices (measured on that index with the map's own default query:
// `search.properties` with NO roof age filter, which is what the Map opens with):
//  - rows exist almost everywhere in Travis County, but their number grows fast with the radius:
//    Central Austin has 4,488 properties within 1 mi and 73,621 within 5 mi, Pflugerville 3,955 /
//    24,864 within 1 / 3 mi. The API answers in about 0.5 s per thousand properties (1 mi about
//    2 s, 3 mi in Pflugerville 5.5 s, 5 mi in Central Austin 14.6 s), and `search.permits` for 5 mi
//    in Central Austin did not answer inside the 28 s Lambda limit. That is a PRODUCT finding (NFR-001
//    is p95 under 3 s); these fixtures therefore use mid-density pins with small radii so the
//    layout and search specs test layout and search, not the Lambda timeout.
//  - Run 3 gives 389,528 of 441,961 properties a roof age (88 percent; 380,018 of them are the
//    year built, confidence low, only 9,510 come from a permit). Run 2 had about 2 percent. A roof
//    age filter therefore no longer empties most areas.
//  - open permits are rare: 15 within 2 mi of the Central Austin pin below.
//
// A new Task A run can move any of these. Specs therefore assert RELATIONS (results exist, widening
// never loses results, every row is inside the ring), and where a fixed property is needed, the B-07
// suite re-reads it from the live index and fails with a clear message when it drifted.
