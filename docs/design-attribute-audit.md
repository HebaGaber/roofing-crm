## Other design-only items noted

Save search and lead-status outlines on markers need a product decision before any build. They
have no data behind them in the contract. Street View and Merged from are disabled "Coming soon"
rows in the drawer; Similar properties is built.

## Roof-age confidence audit

Confidence is shown beside every roof age in: collapsed and expanded result rows, the drawer Roof
section, the Why panel roof rule, the triage card, candidate rows, candidate summary text and the
leads table when the lead stored it. Two gaps remain and need changes outside this change's files:

- Lead detail shows "Confidence: not saved with the lead" (a stated reason). The lead snapshot
  (`LeadCreateAction.tsx`, `agent.ts` signals) does not store `roofAgeConfidence`.
- The Ask agent's row text (`askCopy.ts` `rowRoofText`) shows age and basis without confidence;
  the agent row type does not carry it.
