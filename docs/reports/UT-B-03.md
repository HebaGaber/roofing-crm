# Unit Test Report: B-03 Search a radius for aged roofs and open permits, with full detail

Real `pnpm test` / `pnpm run type-check` / `pnpm run lint` / `pnpm run format` output (Turborepo,
all workspace packages/apps with tests), run locally against branch `003-map-search` at commit
`bb59255` (review round + fixer pass). Includes the two parallel builder groups' work (C2), the
integration-check fixes (C3 — CDK Docker-bundling for `@duckdb/node-api` in the API Lambda), and
the fixer pass that followed the review round (D2).

| `apps/api` | 10 | 65 (up from 7 files / 43 tests at B-02) | ✅ **+3 files / +22 tests** — `search.properties.test.ts`, `search.permits.test.ts`, `property.get.test.ts` |
| `apps/web` (`web`) | 8 | 58 (up from 4 files / 27 tests at B-01) | ✅ **+4 files / +31 tests** — `gps-button.test.tsx`, `radius-control.test.tsx`, plus FilterSheet/ExploreFilters test updates |
| `infra` | 4 | 21 | ✅ (CrmApi suite extended for the new `indexBucketName`/`leadsTableName` props and the Docker-bundled TrpcHandler, memoized once per file) |
| `apps/sync` | 15 | 76 | ✅ (unchanged; not touched by this story) |
| **Total** | **78** | **688** (683 passed, 5 skipped) | **✅** |

(`oracle-views`'s 5 skipped tests predate this story, same as B-02's report — unrelated to B-03's scope.)

## Also verified locally

| Check | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type-check | `pnpm run type-check` | ✅ clean, all 13 Turborepo tasks |
| Lint | `pnpm run lint` (`eslint .`) | ✅ clean (1 real unused-var caught and fixed during the integration check) |
| Format | `pnpm run format` (`prettier --check .`) | ✅ clean (14 files auto-fixed across the integration check and fixer pass) |

Not yet run this round (deferred to Phase E, per the run book): Playwright against a live hosted
preview. `tests/e2e/B-03-map-search.spec.ts` parses and lists correctly (confirmed by the Group 1
builder: `playwright test --list`, 15 tests across 3 viewports) but has not executed against
`RUNTIME_URL`, since no Amplify preview has been deployed yet this session.

## Review round and fixer pass (CR-B-03)

Three parallel reviews (`metagross` 80/100, `audino` 48/100 — below the 75 threshold — and
`/code-review medium`, 8 findings) converged on one Critical: `apps/web/src/routes/Map/Map.tsx`
rendered a hand-rolled `<li>` list instead of the components this story actually built
(`FilterSheet`/`ResultRow`/`PermitChip`/`PropertyDetail`), so the whole feature was unreachable
through the UI. A fixer pass wired all four components in (plus `ExploreFilters.state.ts`'s URL
state via `useSearchParams`) and fixed 6 other real findings: `GpsButton`'s outside-county branch
silently dropping the located point (now matches the map-click path); `CrmMap`'s radius ring
hardcoding a light-mode hex instead of reading `--md-sys-color-primary` live; `MissingReason`
throwing uncaught on an unrecognized reason code (now falls back); `ExploreFilters.state.ts`'s
roof-age parser silently substituting the default on invalid input instead of dropping the filter
(now matches its own documented contract); the 0.5–25 mi radius bound duplicated as four
independent literals (now `MIN_RADIUS_MI`/`MAX_RADIUS_MI` in `packages/domain`); and a stale
"known gap" comment in `leadIndex.ts` that the CDK fix had already resolved.

`audino` re-scored the fix: **84/100**, Critical confirmed resolved by reading the current code
directly. Three lower-severity findings were deliberately left out of this fix pass (recorded, not
silently dropped): `RadiusControl.module.css`'s border-radius token choice, two unmodeled GPS
states (explain-first, low-accuracy) and one state-name mismatch, and `ResultRow`'s display of raw
lat/lon instead of an address/distance (blocked on Task A's FU-A-01, same gap the design decision
already anticipated — see `docs/02-design.md`).

## Sign-off

**Decision:** ☐ Validated (counts toward G7) ☐ Returned, reason: {…} · pending Phase E (hosted
proof) and the user's G7 approval (Round 2).
