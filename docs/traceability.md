# Traceability: Roofing CRM (Task B)

There are two matrices. The **requirements matrix** gives each README acceptance criterion and demo line one row. The **chain matrix** follows each feature down to its release. An empty cell means something is missing.

Every artifact names its parent in its front matter, so the `developmentsupport-progress` skill can rebuild the chain matrix from the files. You fill only the first matrix by hand.

Source: `README.md` at commit `f874802`. Evaluation points B1–B6 are defined in `docs/01-intent.md` § 8. Stories and evidence files follow `../assessment-guide/reference/B-roofing-crm.md` § 5–6; FEAT IDs come at G1, spec FRs at G5, test cases at G6, demo times at release.

## 1. Requirements matrix (README → evidence)

*Story merge (2026-10-21, before P8):* the 11 stories run as 5 merged stories. Story IDs here are **part** IDs: B-10 → B-01 · B-04, B-05, B-06 → B-03 · B-08 → B-07 · B-11 → B-09. Evidence for a part goes in its merged story's file, one section per part (for example `docs/evidence/B-03.md` § B-04).

Rows: AC-n = acceptance criteria, R-n = requirements stated only in Context or Description, OOS-n = out-of-scope items (proved by their absence or a mock), D-n = demo transcript lines.

| # | README criterion / demo line | Eval point | FEAT | Story (US) | Spec FR | Test case | Evidence | Demo time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC-1 | Default the map and search experience to a particular county, with support for exploring properties in the user's selected area. | B1 | FEAT-B01 | B-01 | FR-001 | TC-001, TC-006, TC-010 | docs/evidence/B-01.md | 2026-10-23 |
| AC-2 | Allow users to center property search on current GPS location and/or a pin dropped on the map. | B1 | FEAT-B03 | B-03 | | | docs/evidence/B-03.md | |

| AC-4 | Display properties within the radius that have roofs older than a configurable age threshold (default suggestion: 15 years). | B2 | FEAT-B04, FEAT-B02 | B-04 (data: B-02) | | | docs/evidence/B-04.md | |
| AC-5 | Display properties within the radius that have open roofing permits, with emphasis on permits that have remained open for an extended period. | B3 | FEAT-B05, FEAT-B02 | B-05 (data: B-02) | | | docs/evidence/B-05.md | |
| AC-6 | Show permit details in the UI, including permit status, age/open duration, contractor name, and BBB rating score when available. | B3 | FEAT-B06 | B-06 | | | docs/evidence/B-06.md | |
| AC-7 | Present a browsable list of matching roofing lead candidates derived from the map/radius filters. | B6 | FEAT-B08 | B-08 | | | docs/evidence/B-08.md | |
| AC-8 | Support creating and managing CRM lead records from identified properties and permits. | B4 | FEAT-B07 | B-07 | | | docs/evidence/B-07.md | |
| AC-9 | Provide a RAG-backed agent that answers natural-language queries about roofing opportunities using available property and permit data. | B5 | FEAT-B09 | B-09 | | | docs/evidence/B-09.md | |
| AC-10 | Keep data gathering, ingestion, and source-system integration out of scope; consume pre-existing/available datasets. | B6 (also the access boundary) | FEAT-B02 | B-02 | | | docs/evidence/B-02.md | |
| AC-11 | Show (disabled) sections on the CRM that would expand the product beyond the initial lead-identification workflow. | B6 | FEAT-B10 | B-10 | FR-004, FR-005 | TC-005, TC-008, TC-009 | docs/evidence/B-01.md § B-10 | 2026-10-23 |
| R-1 | Context: finding and qualifying **residential and commercial** roofing leads. | B2 | FEAT-B04, FEAT-B02 | B-04 (data: B-02) | | | docs/evidence/B-04.md | |
| R-2 | Context: turn signals into **actionable outreach opportunities**. | B4 | FEAT-B07 | B-07 | | | docs/evidence/B-07.md | |
| R-3 | Description: the UI presents **property** and permit details, including contractor information. | B3 | FEAT-B06 | B-06 | | | docs/evidence/B-06.md | |
| R-4 | Description: example agent query "show me open roofing permits older than five years within five miles of [city xyz]". | B5 | FEAT-B09 | B-09 (golden query) | | | docs/evidence/B-09.md | |
| OOS-1 | Out of scope: property, permit, ownership or enrichment data collection and ingestion pipelines. | B6 (access boundary) | FEAT-B02 | B-02 | | | docs/evidence/B-02.md | |
| OOS-2 | Out of scope: live BBB API integration beyond displaying scores already in the data. | B3 | FEAT-B06, FEAT-B14 | B-06 | | | docs/evidence/B-06.md | |
| OOS-3 | Out of scope: actual outbound messaging to property owners (can be mocked or deferred). | B6 | FEAT-B10, FEAT-B13 | B-10 | | | docs/evidence/B-10.md | |
| D-1 | Open the CRM centered on a particular county. | B1 | FEAT-B01 | B-01 | FR-001 | TC-001 | docs/evidence/B-01.md | 2026-10-23 |
