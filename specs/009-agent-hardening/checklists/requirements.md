# Specification Quality Checklist: Grounded agent + production hardening + real-data switch + prototype re-audit

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items pass. FR-001..FR-008 map 1:1 to the story's AC-1..AC-8. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed — the two load-bearing unknowns (A-13/A-14 reuse unavailable; Atlas registration pending) were already resolved with the user as documented deviations before this spec was written, and are captured in Assumptions rather than left open.
